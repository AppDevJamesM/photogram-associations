# Photogram Associations

In this project, we'll re-write our association accessor methods using [ActiveRecord's powerful Association helpers](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html).

There are no automated tests; this is just for practice. Play around in the `rails console` as you make changes to ensure that the changes you are making are having the desired effects.

Use this tool to help plan out your new association methods:
